# My private portfolio
Presentation of some projects that I did on some companies that I worked on which I can't share the code base due to Privacy Policies.

## How is this repository organized:
1. Each project is a folder 
2. Each folder has a name pattern: [InitialDateOfMyContract - EndDateOfMyContract_NameOfTheCompany]
3. Each folder will have the following structure ([D] = Directory, [F] = File, [O] = Optional):
   1. Architecture[DO]: Images and flowcharts of the projects architecure
   2. CodeHighlights[DO]: Some highlights of interesting code that I did on the project and that made me proud.
   3. Overview[F]: Video overview of the project
   4. OtherFilesOnProjectRoot[FO]: Some other files or videos that further explain the project

## How to navigate here:
1. Choose the project you want to learn more about
2. Go inside the folder
3. Watch Overview video
4. Watch / read any other file / video on the root of the project
5. Read architecture documentations if you want
6. Navigate some code highlights on CodeHighlights
